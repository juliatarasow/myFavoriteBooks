This book was written from one of my favorite writers of all times: [Chimamanda Adichie](https://www.chimamanda.com/)
Americanah is her last novel, published in 2013, and tells the story of a young Nigerian woman, Ifemelu, who immigrates to the USA to attend university.
I read this book at my first year in Germany and it has spoken with me deeply. It has helped me to better understand my onw experience of been foreign.
It's a beautiful book.
